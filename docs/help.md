## üìã Main Features Overview

BlogBuddy provides two ways to interact with AI:

### 1. Menu-Based Commands (Ctrl+Shift+B)
Access organized features through an interactive menu interface.

### 2. Inline BB Commands
Embed special tags directly in your text for instant AI processing.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è BB Command System

The BB command system allows you to embed AI instructions directly in your text using special tags. You can place commands on the same line as your content or on separate lines. Place your cursor anywhere in the text block (or select specific text) and press `Cmd+B Cmd+B` (Mac) or `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` (Win/Linux) to execute.

**How it works:**
- **Text Block Mode**: When BB command is in the same text block (separated by blank lines) with other content, processes only that text block
- **Full Document Mode**: When BB command is alone on its own line with blank lines above and below (no other content in the text block), processes the entire document
- **Manual Selection**: When you manually select text, processes only the selected text regardless of mode

### Command Syntax
```
<command:optional-message>
```

### Available BB Commands

#### 1. `<bb-expd:additional-context>` - Text Expansion
**Purpose**: Expand and elaborate on existing content while preserving meaning
**Usage**: Place command in the same text block as content you want to expand
**Examples**:
```markdown
Machine learning is changing software development.
<bb-expd:make this suitable for a technical blog>

API design is important for scalability.
<bb-expd:add practical examples and use cases>
```
**Features**:
- Reads full document context for coherent expansion
- Maintains original tone and style
- Adds concrete examples and elaborative details
- Ensures natural integration with surrounding content

#### 2. `<bb-impv:style-instructions>` - Text Improvement
**Purpose**: Enhance clarity, grammar, and overall quality of text
**Usage**: Two distinct modes based on content selection
**Examples**:

**Text Block Mode (has content):**
```markdown
This paragraph has some repetitive content that says the same thing multiple times in different ways.
<bb-impv:make more concise and remove redundancy>

The API endpoint kinda works but sometimes it's slow.
<bb-impv:improve professional tone>
```

**Full Document Mode (command isolated by blank lines):**
```markdown
Some content above...

<bb-impv:improve the entire document's professional tone>

Some content below...

---

Other content above...

<bb-impv:enhance grammar and readability throughout the document>

Other content below...
```

**Behavior**:
- **Text Block Mode**: When BB command shares a text block with other content, improves only that text block in-place with document context
- **Full Document Mode**: When BB command is isolated by blank lines (alone in its text block), processes the entire document and creates a new file with `_improved` suffix

**Features**:
- Fixes grammar, spelling, and punctuation
- Enhances sentence structure and flow  
- Maintains author's voice and style
- Uses full document context for consistency

#### 3. `<bb-tslt:target-language>` - Translation
**Purpose**: Translate entire documents to specified languages

<bb-tslt:‰∏≠Êñá>
<bb-tslt:Japanese>
<bb-tslt:Fran√ßais>
<bb-tslt:translate to Spanish>
```
**Features**:
- Translates entire document (not just selected text)
- Creates new file with language suffix
- Preserves markdown formatting and structure
- Handles code blocks appropriately
- Generates markdown link to translated version

#### 4. `<bb-mmd:diagram-instructions>` - Mermaid Diagrams
**Purpose**: Generate Mermaid diagrams by analyzing text content and converting it to visual representations
**Usage**: Place command in a text block that describes a process, workflow, or system structure
**Examples**:
```markdown
User registration process:
1. User enters email and password
2. System validates credentials
3. If valid, create account
4. Send confirmation email
5. User confirms email
6. Account activated
<bb-mmd:create a flowchart>

API Authentication Flow:
- Client sends credentials to /auth endpoint
- Server validates credentials
- Server returns JWT token
- Client includes token in subsequent requests
- Server validates token on each request
<bb-mmd:make this a sequence diagram>
```
**Features**:
- Analyzes text content to understand structure and relationships
- Automatically chooses appropriate diagram type (flowchart, sequence, class, state, ER, gantt, pie)
- Can output as code block or SVG image (configurable in settings)
- Validates generated Mermaid syntax using Kroki service
- Creates properly formatted, syntactically correct diagrams

#### 5. `<bb-kwd:keyword-focus>` - Keyword Extraction
**Purpose**: Extract SEO-friendly keywords from content
**Usage**: Analyzes document content to generate relevant keywords

#### 7. `<bb-tag>` - BB Badge
**Purpose**: Add BlogBuddy attribution badge
**Usage**: Simple tag insertion
**Example**:
```markdown
<bb-tag>
```
**Output**: `[![BB](https://img.shields.io/badge/created_with-BB-FFD900)](https://github.com/FulcrumStd/blogbuddy)`

#### 8. `<bb:your-instruction>` - General AI Tasks ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Purpose**: Execute any AI task with custom instructions
**Usage**: Two distinct modes based on content selection

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice**: This is the most powerful and flexible command. Due to the complexity and open-ended nature of tasks, it may require higher-performance AI models and could result in significantly higher token usage and costs compared to other specialized commands. Use judiciously for tasks that cannot be accomplished with the specific commands above.

**Examples**:

**Text Block Mode (has content):**
```markdown
This is some casual text that needs improvement.
<bb:rewrite this in a more professional tone>

AI is useful for many tasks.
<bb:add examples and make it more detailed>

- Feature 1: Description
- Feature 2: Description
<bb:convert this list to a table format>
```

**Full Document Mode (command isolated by blank lines):**
```markdown
Some previous content here.

<bb:rewrite the entire document in a more professional tone>

Some following content here.

---

Other content above...

<bb:convert all lists in this document to table format>

Other content below...
```

**Behavior**:
- **Text Block Mode**: When BB command shares a text block with other content, processes only that text block in-place
- **Full Document Mode**: When BB command is isolated by blank lines (alone in its text block), processes the entire document and creates a new file with `_processed` suffix

**Performance Considerations**:
- May require more powerful AI models for complex instructions
- Can consume significantly more tokens than specialized commands
- Processing time may be longer for complex tasks
- Consider using specific commands (expd, impv, tslt, etc.) when possible for better efficiency

## üí° Pro Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Master Blank Line Control**: Blank lines determine processing scope
   - **Same text block** (no blank lines): Processes only that content
   - **Isolated by blank lines**: Processes entire document
2. **Choose Your Mode**:
   - For local edits: Place commands with content in the same text block (no blank lines between)
   - For full document processing: Isolate commands with blank lines above and below
3. **Context Matters**: BB commands read your entire document for better context
4. **Be Specific**: Provide clear instructions in command messages
5. **File Types**: Works best with Markdown (.md) files
6. **Backup Important Work**: BB creates new files for document-level operations

### Workflow Integration
1. **Draft First**: Write your initial content, then enhance with BB commands
2. **Iterative Improvement**: Use multiple commands for progressive enhancement
3. **Review Output**: Always review AI-generated content before finalizing
4. **Combine Features**: Use expansion ‚Üí improvement ‚Üí translation workflows

### Command Combinations

**Text Block Mode (local processing):**
```markdown
Your initial paragraph here.
<bb-expd:add technical details>

After expansion, this content needs polishing.
<bb-impv:make more professional>
```

**Full Document Mode (document-wide processing):**
```markdown
Some content here...

<bb-impv:improve grammar and readability throughout the entire document>
