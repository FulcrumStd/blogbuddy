## The premise

You're writing Markdown. You want AI help — to expand, polish, translate, summarise, diagram. Most tools yank you out to a chat window, then back, then out again.

**BlogBuddy puts the verbs in your prose.** Drop a tag like `<bb-expd:add concrete examples>` into a paragraph, press `Cmd+B Cmd+B`, and the tag (plus the surrounding block) is replaced by streaming AI output — without leaving the cursor.

That's the entire idea. Everything else is doing it well.

---

## The tag, in one screen

```markdown
Machine learning is changing how software gets written.
<bb-expd:make this suitable for a senior engineering audience>
```

Place the cursor in that paragraph. Hit `Cmd+B Cmd+B`. The tag disappears, the paragraph expands, words stream in token by token. Scope is inferred from where the tag sits — same line, full paragraph, or whole document.

---

## The vocabulary

Eight inline commands plus a four-preset reader. All accept an optional refinement after the colon: `<bb-foo:say more about X>`.

| Tag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `<bb:any instruction>` | Free-form. Hand BB any task; it works on the current scope. The flexible escape hatch |
| `<bb-expd:focus>` | Expand and elaborate, keeping tone |
| `<bb-impv:focus>` | Polish for clarity. Inline mode rewrites the block; standalone tag rewrites the whole document into `*_improved.md` |
| `<bb-tslt:target language>` | Translate the document. Outputs `myblog_日本語.md` and a link |
| `<bb-tldr:style>` | Inline TL;DR summary |
| `<bb-mmd:diagram type>` | Generate a fenced Mermaid block. Picks flowchart / sequence / class / state / ER / gantt / pie automatically |
| `<bb-kwd:focus>` | 8–12 SEO-friendly keywords |
| `<bb-tag>` | Insert a "created with BB" attribution badge |
| `<bb-render-blog:>` `<bb-render-skim:>` `<bb-render-expl:>` `<bb-render:prompt>` | AI Reader View — see below |

> **Streaming everywhere.** Output appears as the model writes it. **Context-aware.** BB reads the surrounding document, not just the highlighted text. **Smart scope.** Cursor position alone tells BB whether to rewrite a line, a paragraph, or the whole file.

## BB Editor — a WYSIWYG that respects Markdown

A built-in rich-text editor for `.md` files, powered by [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev). Open it from the Explorer (`Cmd+B` on a `.md` file) or the editor title bar. It saves as plain Markdown, with predictable normalisation.

- **WYSIWYG with full GFM** — tables, strikethrough, task lists, autolinks, blockquotes, fenced code
- **Slash menu (`/`)** — block types and every BB command, pre-filled
- **Inline `Cmd+B Cmd+B`** — fire any `<bb-*>` tag without leaving the canvas
- **Streaming AI blocks** — results appear inline as a typed ProseMirror node
- **Frontmatter Properties panel** — `title` · `date` · `tags` · `categories` · `author` · `slug` · `draft` · `description` rendered as typed controls (date picker, chip input, toggle, textarea). Raw YAML remains available as a collapsible fallback
- **Prism syntax highlighting** — 20+ languages; palette tracks VS Code light / dark / high-contrast themes
- **IME-safe** — CJK composition events guard auto-save and BB triggers
- **Arrow ligatures** — `->` → `→`, `=>` → `⇒` outside code and IME
- **Compact save** — bullets normalised to `-`, blank lines collapsed, entities decoded — Git diffs stay quiet
- **External-change banner** — if the file is touched on disk while you have unsaved edits, choose Reload or Keep
- **Paste-to-disk assets** — images and files dropped into the canvas are written next to the document (or under `blogbuddy.assetDir`) and inserted as relative paths
- **Auto-save** with `Cmd+S` to flush

---

## AI Reader View — your Markdown, redesigned

Trigger `<bb-render-*>` and the AI re-interprets your document as a complete HTML "reading artifact" — rendered in a side panel, never touching your source file.

| Preset | The brief to the model |
|---|---|
| `<bb-render-blog:>` | Polished article — sticky TOC, callouts, comfortable measure |
| `<bb-render-skim:>` | TL;DR up top, dense visual structure, `<details>` for skippable depth |
| `<bb-render-expl:>` | Teaching artifact — SVG diagrams, code annotations, "why this matters" sidebars |
| `<bb-render:your prompt>` | Custom — your prompt drives the entire creative direction |

- **Live streaming preview** in a sandboxed iframe — watch the HTML compose itself
- **Editable refinement prompt + Regenerate** — tweak without re-typing the tag
- **Self-contained `.html` export** — local images base64-inlined by default (toggle `blogbuddy.reader.inlineAssets` for relative paths instead)
- **`.bbreader.md` style reference** (optional) — drop one at your workspace root describing typography, colors, components; every render uses it as authoritative style guidance. Scaffold via **BlogBuddy: Create .bbreader.md Template**
- **Source-changed banner** — re-render on demand, never automatic (renders are slow and metered)
- **Cost guard** at ~25k input tokens — large docs prompt for confirmation before spending

## Quick start

1. Install **BlogBuddy** from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Set credentials — either `blogbuddy.apiKey` in settings, **or** export `BLOGBUDDY_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
3. *(Optional)* set `blogbuddy.baseURL` for OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, your own proxy). Default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`.
4. Run **BlogBuddy: Select Model** from the command palette — picks from `/v1/models`, or enter a custom id.
5. Open a `.md` file, drop a tag, press `Cmd+B Cmd+B`.

## Reference

### Keybindings

| Where | Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown editor | `Cmd+B Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` | Execute BB on the current block or selection |
| Explorer (on a `.md` file) | `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B` | Open BB Editor |
| BB Editor | `/` | Slash menu (BB commands + block types) |
| BB Editor | `Cmd+B Cmd+B` | Fire an inline `<bb-*>` tag |
| BB Editor | `Cmd+S` | Save immediately |
| BB Editor | `Backspace` (at start of heading) | Convert heading back to paragraph |

### Settings

Only `apiKey` and `model` are required; everything else has sensible defaults.

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `blogbuddy.apiKey` | API key. Falls back to `$BLOGBUDDY_API_KEY` → `$OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `blogbuddy.baseURL` | OpenAI-compatible base URL. Falls back to `$BLOGBUDDY_BASE_URL` → `$OPENAI_BASE_URL` → `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `blogbuddy.model` | Model id. Use **BlogBuddy: Select Model** to pick from the provider's list |
| `blogbuddy.assetDir` | Relative subdirectory for BB Editor uploads (e.g. `assets`). Empty = alongside the document |
| `blogbuddy.reader.inlineAssets` | Inline local images as base64 when exporting Reader HTML. Default `true` |

### Commands

Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `BlogBuddy:`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BlogBuddy: Hi BB` | Execute BB on the current scope (same as the chord) |
| `BlogBuddy: Open BB Editor` | Open the current `.md` in BB Editor |
| `BlogBuddy: Select Model` | Fetch `/v1/models` and pick (or enter) a model id |
| `BlogBuddy: Show Config Diagnostics` | Masked report of what the extension actually resolves for each field |
| `BlogBuddy: Show Usage Statistics` | Token usage, request counts, per-model cost (where pricing is available) |
| `BlogBuddy: Reset Usage Statistics` | Clear all counters (with confirmation) |
| `BlogBuddy: Refresh Pricing Data` | Re-fetch pricing data |
| `BlogBuddy: Create .bbreader.md Template` | Scaffold the AI Reader style-reference template |

### Status bar

Two right-side items, both Markdown-only:

- **Word count** — Chinese characters and English words counted separately and summed
- **Config source** — `$(key) BB · cfg | env | default` shows where your `apiKey` resolves from; turns yellow on missing key or model. Hover for the per-field source table; click to open Diagnostics

## Notes

> **Development status.** BlogBuddy is in active development. Features may move, break, or change between versions. Please use with judgement in production workflows.
>
> **Experimental.** The free-form `<bb:>` command is the most flexible and the most token-hungry — prefer specialised tags when one fits.

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS — env var not picked up?</strong></summary>

Apps launched from Dock or Spotlight don't inherit your shell config. Two fixes:

- **From Terminal:** `source ~/.zshrc && code .`
- **Persistent:** `launchctl setenv OPENAI_API_KEY 'sk-...'`, then ⌘Q and relaunch VS Code

Run **BlogBuddy: Show Config Diagnostics** to verify what the extension host actually sees.

## Made for

Bloggers and content writers · technical writers who need diagrams and translations · multilingual authors · anyone who'd rather press a key than open a tab.
