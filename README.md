## ‚ú® What is Blog Buddy?

Blog Buddy (BB) is a VS Code extension designed to enhance your blog writing workflow without disrupting your creative flow. Instead of switching contexts or opening external tools, you simply insert BB command tags directly in your Markdown content and trigger them with keyboard shortcuts. It's that simple!

## üöÄ Key Features

### Smart Command Tags
Use intuitive command tags anywhere in your blog posts (all tags support `<bb-xxx:custom instructions>` format):
- `<bb:task description>` - Direct AI agent mode - give BB any task to complete
- `<bb-expd:expansion requirements>` - Expand and elaborate on surrounding text content
- `<bb-impv:improvement focus>` - Polish text quality (inline for local text, standalone for full document)
- `<bb-tslt:target language>` - Translate content (must specify target language)
- `<bb-tldr:summary style>` - Generate TL;DR summaries
- `<bb-mmd:diagram description>` - Generate Mermaid diagrams
- `<bb-kwd:keyword focus>` - Extract keywords
- `<bb-tag>` - Add BlogBuddy attribution badge

### Seamless Workflow Integration
- **Non-intrusive**: Commands are embedded directly in your content
- **Keyboard-driven**: Activate with simple key combinations
- **Context-aware**: AI understands your full document context
- **Instant results**: Commands execute and replace content in-place

### AI-Powered Assistance

- **Expand** brief ideas into full paragraphs
- **Improve** text clarity, grammar, and flow
- **Translate** content to different languages
